## Professional Experience

### Fullstack React + NestJS Developer
**Squaduplabs LLC** – Boston, MA | Feb 2025 - Present

**Enterprise SaaS Development:** Tasked with building 3 production platforms from scratch with tight deadlines and low existing infrastructure. Architected and delivered complete SaaS applications (Voice AI for legal tech, HR assessments, business intelligence) using React, NestJS, and multi-tenant database designs with 20+ entities each.

**AWS Serverless Architecture:** Company needed cost-effective scalable infrastructure. Designed serverless solutions using AWS Lambda, CDK, SQS queues, S3 storage, EventBridge schedulers, and CloudFront CDN. Cut infrastructure costs by 40% vs traditional servers while handling thousands of daily transactions.

**Voice AI Platform:** Legal firms needed automated 24/7 client intake. Built end-to-end call management system integrating Vapi and Twilio for AI-powered phone assistants, with call recording, transcription, lead qualification algorithms, and real-time Email/SMS notifications. System now handles client screening autonomously, qualifying leads while attorneys sleep.

**Advanced Web Scraping:** Required large-scale data extraction from Google Maps without triggering rate limits. Engineered scraping system with header spoofing and proxy rotation to reliably gather business intelligence at scale. Database now powers competitive analysis features.

**Payment & Testing Infrastructure:** Implemented Stripe subscriptions, webhooks, and credit-based billing across all products. Established comprehensive testing (Jest, E2E via GitHub Actions) with strict TypeScript standards, reducing production defects 35%.

### Fullstack React + Node Developer
**Valdera Inc** – San Francisco, CA | April 2022 - Feb 2025

**Data Engineering at Scale:** Chemical supplier data was fragmented across hundreds of websites with no centralized source. Architected custom scraping pipelines for 10+ sites using user-agent rotation, request throttling, and session management to avoid detection. Built industry-leading database with 50,000+ supplier records that became core competitive advantage.

**Quality & Testing Initiative:** Production defects were impacting customer trust. Led testing overhaul that increased Cypress E2E coverage from 15% to 55% with automated regression testing in CI/CD. Reduced defects by 20% while maintaining bi-weekly release cadence over 3 years.

**Component Library:** Teams were duplicating UI code across projects. Designed and built shared React + TypeScript component library with consistent patterns. Reduced code duplication 40%, accelerated feature development 25%, and library was adopted by 3 products.

**CI/CD Optimization:** Deployment bottlenecks were slowing releases. Refactored GitHub Actions and GCloud Build pipelines with parallel test execution and intelligent caching. Cut deployment time from 12 to 6 minutes (50% faster).

**Technical Mentorship:** Trained 3 junior developers on React patterns, TypeScript best practices, and component architecture design.

### Fullstack React + Node Developer
**Darwoft S.A** – Córdoba, Argentina | May 2021 - April 2022

**Rapid MVP Development:** Clients needed fast time-to-market for validation. Led ReactJS development for 3 MVPs using agile methodology and rapid iteration cycles. Accelerated delivery speed 30% through smart component reuse and efficient state management. All 3 launched on time and transitioned to production with customers.

**Authentication Systems:** Projects required secure multi-platform authentication. Integrated and configured AWS Cognito, Clerk, and Better Auth with OAuth flows, session management, and role-based access control across different client tech stacks.

**Responsive UI/UX:** Built component libraries matching each client's design system with cross-browser compatibility and mobile-first approach, establishing foundation for long-term product evolution.
